As with all great stories, we start with chapter one… At DataKind Singapore, we have worked with several Social Sector Partners to deliver data projects that aim to derive insights from their data and produce analyses and data products. We have since organized multiple Meetups to work on these data projects. This is a book on the lessons learnt and best practices derived from these data projects on executing large collaborative data projects. NOTE: This book is still in Alpha with many sections to be fleshed out. We seek your understanding should you encounter these sections. Nevertheless we still hope you have learnt a few tips from here. Goals Understand NGO’s requirements fully and translate requirements into clear specific tasks Quick view and easy management of project progress Facilitate sharing and mass collaboration Reproducible pipeline, from environment to code, data analyses, documentation and products Requirements traceability Meant to be a guide rather than a dogmatic approach for future DataKind Data Ambassadorss, Project Managers and Data Experts as well as anyone involved in data projects "],

This helps to set the context and helps you relate to the recommended practices described in this book. Subsequently we shall be taking a deep dive into the specific topics. While each of these chapters can be read independently depending on your needs, it references the project flow heavily and it helps if you read this chapter first. 1.1 Project Funnel In the picture below, you will see the project funnel that DataKind SG uses to assist our social sector partners DataKind Project Funnel 1.2 Project Accelerators This is the session where we bring the data science community together with our social sector partners in brainstorming sessions to take the first steps towards a successful data science project. 1.3 DataJams Once data has been obtained, we hold DataJam sessions that bring the data experts together with social sector partners to clean up and prepare the data prior to DataDives and/or DataCorps 1.4 DataDive DataDives are where the data experts and social sector partners collaborate to generate data solutions and/or products, tackling tough problems over the course of a weekend. 1.5 DataCorps DataCorps are specialized teams of pro bono data scientists who work on indepth, 6 to 9-month projects for social sector partners. 1.6 DataLearn From time-to-time, we may also conduct DataLearn sessions, where we help prepare our volunteers for DataDives through hands-on tutorials and workshops.
